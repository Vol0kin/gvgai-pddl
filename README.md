# gvgai-pddl
Implementation of a PDDL-based agent in GVGAI. This project is being developed as part
of my Bachelor's thesis.

This project makes use of the *PDDL Solver* from [planning.domains](http://planning.domains/).
If you want to have more information about this solver and how you can use it in
your own project, please check [the following page](http://solver.planning.domains/).
